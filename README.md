# Integration between OpenStreetMap and authoritative geospatial datasets

This repository includes ideas, materials, datasets and processing workflows about the comparison and integration between OpenStreetMap and authoritative geospatial datasets provided by national mapping agencies in the European Union. It currently includes:

* the material presented at a workshop titled "OpenStreetMap and its synergies with INSPIRE", given at the [2020 online INSPIRE Conference](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conference2020) on June 11, 2020
* the results of a more comprehensive research project carried out in 2021 to investigate the enablers and barriers of OpenStreetMap integration with authoritative geospatial datasets from EU national mapping agencies
